# HTML-code

Sprint #1

● First, we made a brainstorming to find an idea of website to do. After finding our project, we thought about the design of the website. When we had an idea of design, we decided to code the first page to see if we can made what we want. After doing a good first page, we will start on the other page of the site.

● We started by the design of the website to have an idea a preview of our webiste, when we are satisfied of that, we continue with the content of the website (photo, text...) and if we see something that can be improve, we change it.

●We chose the waterfall method because that is the better one for us, it reflects how our team works, we work step by step, we have an idea we design it and after we transform in code, that's for everything we do on the project. We thinked about the fact how we can made it, we schematize it and finally code it.

● Everyone work on a page :
  -Romain code the home page with our help but he is the one who code that because he want to do the first design of the site and it was he who had the idea of the design, so we let him happen.
  - Florian code the page "cyberharcèlement", he wanted to work on that because he wanted to learn about this form of harassment. He didn't know a lot about this subject and he was interest about that.
  -Tristan code the dangerosity of internet because he wants to know the "dark part" of internet and how to avoid many problems on Internet.
For the moment this is the repartition of the task.

Sprint #2

1/

- We have updated a lot of things, we remake the design of the header, the footer, the color of the website we just let the text and the images since last time. And we add three pages that is "Our services", "Our Team" and "Shop".

- Our first sprint was not very organised so we decided to change that to the second one, we remade the to do list on Trello and we divided the tasks fairly. So, we had a very good organisation and we worked efficiently to not lost time. We noticed that work, so we achieved a lot of thing in less time.

- We had difficulties to code everything we want because we had only one week of courses about html and css. So, we didn't know a lot of thing about this language of programmation. We saw many videos to explian us the language and help us to code the pages that we wanted, we learned many things and we enjoyed learning that.

2/ 

- We change color of text, we had an animation on text with a pointer, we had an animation on the buttons with a pointer.

- We had animation on images on the "Our Team" page.

3/

- You can see the design on the folder folder src when you have the html and css.

- Same that the first point.

- We create components to have a better visibility on the code to see the diferents part of the code.
